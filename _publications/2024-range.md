This paper investigates performance guarantees on coverage-based ergodic exploration methods in environments containing disturbances. This is applicable in situations when the exploring robot must content with time-varying challenges, such as wind or moving obstacles. 
We formulate ergodic exploration as a game between the controller optimizing for ergodicity and an external disturbance, and then we use reachability analysis to find the optimal controller strategy.

<i>The <a href='https://ialab.yale.edu/'>Intelligent Autonomy Lab</a> is a research lab in the Mechanical Engineering department at Yale, led by Prof. Ian Abraham. The lab focuses on controls for robotics.</i>

I'm researching controllers for autonomous robots used for search and exploration. I'm mostly focused on the theory, but these methods have many applications, in areas such as search and rescue, mapping, and extraterrestrial exploration.

More specifically, I'm working on controllers that perform [ergodic exploration](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7350162). Given an estimate of how much information is likely to be found in each part of the search space, the robot seeks to find an ergodic trajectory---a trajectory that, on average, spends time in each part of the serach space in proportion to how much information is likely to be found there.

My research has had two main thrusts, listed below.

Time-Optimal Ergodic Search
------

The goal of this project is to perform ergodic exploration as _quickly_ as possible. This is useful in situations when time is of essence, e.g. search and rescue operations. I've written two peer-reviewed papers on this topic. See the _Publications_ section of the website for more information, linked here:

- [Time-Optimal Ergodic Search](/publication/time-optimal-ergodic-search). DE Dong, H Berger, and I Abraham. Presented at Robotics: Science and Systems 2023.
- [Multiscale Time-Optimal Ergodic Search](/publication/multiscale-time-optimal-ergodic-search) DE Dong, H Berger, and I Abraham. In the International Journal of Robotics Research, forthcoming.

RAnGE: Reachability Analysis for Guaranteed Ergodicity
------

The goal of this project is to perform ergodic exploration _safely_ in the presence of dynamic hazards. This is useful in situations when the exploring robot must content with time-varying challenges, such as wind or moving obstacles. I'm using reachability analysis, a technique for providing safety guarantees. I've written one paper on this topic. See the _Publications_ section of the website for more information, linked here:

- [RAnGE: Reachability for Ergodic Search](/publication/range) H Berger and I Abraham. [TBD]

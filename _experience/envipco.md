excerpt: "<i><a href='https://www.envipco.com/'>Envipco</a> is a company that makes reverse vending machines (machines that let people return recyclables in exchange for a deposit).</i><br><br>For my senior capstone in Mechanical Engineering, I worked with three other students and Envipco to design a bulk-feed intake module for a reverse vending machine. This module will allow users to pour all their bottles into the machine at once, instead of feeding them one at a time."

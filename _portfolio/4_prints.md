Here are some of my favorite 3D-printing projects:

- <b>"Camera Flipper"</b>: In my first semester of college, all classes were online, and I wanted to have my camera on during the Zoom class. However, I take notes on my tablet, so I had to have my tablet flat on the desk, so the camera would point straight up and not show my face. I 3D-printed this "flipper" that holds a small mirror over the camera, so that I can be on video as I take notes.

- <b>Dorm model</b>: Using approximate measurements from Google Earth, I made a model of my dorm building. I've given copies of this as a gift to people within the college, such as my dean and first-year counselor.

- <b>Cat door</b>: I made a cat door for my cat, Gilly, complete with a gothic G for her. (My family now has a second cat, Kiwi, but I haven't had the occasion to print anything for her yet.)

- <b>Soap holder</b>: Probably my most practical print. The showers in my dorm bathroom had a mount for a soap holder but no soap holder, so I printed one.
